MusicKnows
==========

Keep it simple.

"Music companies fuck everything up with DRM and Copyright, the one thing left they don't own are our memories."

Use :through to do funky band/venue stuff - http://matthewman.net/articles/2006/01/06/rails-activerecord-goes-through

Auto-suggest band and song data from musicbrainz, cddb or ???

Offer a title, description and photo upload feature

Tagging for locations, tagging for descriptions

Add friends to a memory, band, venue, location or picture

Re-read Tom's review of that portfolio site

Make it into a passive, episodic gaming experience

Ways to view the underlying data:

	by date (like a blog)
	by artist
	by venue
	by user
	by keyword

* MusicMemories - DRM can't stop you remembering. 
Location based music tagging website. 
Where you heard a song, why it makes it special, social network of music-related memories. Needs venues, locations, friends and reasons. Like Folklore for Choooons.

User POV
========

The proposition is - share your memories
					 talk about music
					 show off

The reward is - find people with similar interests, 
				talk about music, 
				organise your friends around events, 
				publicise upcoming events
				find out about your music habits


So the form for entering data should be....

By date? or By venue? or By artist/band? or By record?

	By date gives you options of 'The 60s', 'The 70s', '1994', '1982', or '24th Sept. 2006' etc.
	By date gives you decades, years or specific date/time.

	By venue just gives you an input box to enter, with autocomplete on venue names
	
	By artist/band gives you an input box to enter, with autocomplete again (possibly coming from musicbrainz)
	
	By record gives you the same input box to enter, with autocomplete from musicbrainz
	
So the initial options are Who, What, Where and When (Band, Album, Venue, Date)


Flash Friends App
=================

This is the core idea at the moment - sorting through polaroids of your friends like Coverflow.

The app will read from an xml file the list of friend ids and the path it can find those images.
Each friend will have a nick, photograph and id specificed in the xml
The xml will also have a 'submit' path, that tells it where to submit the ids.

In effect, the xml will govern how the app works, so that changes can be made at a later stage by me, without the need for a flash developer.

The app itself will show all your friends in the bottom half (scrollable) and a group area in the top half, where you can pick and move certain friends to. So, if I wanted to collect up all the firends i went to see the black crowes with, I'd drag them from below and drop them up top. Hit save and the ids of those friends will be sent to the database along with the event details.

Ideally, I like to be able to choose a friends picture by selecting from their list of public avatars, or from my own pictures that I attach to them. Not a must-have though.

what *service* do we provide?

	are we in any sense software?
	it's just a way of making and meeting friends.
	so judge the userbase and offer a PRO account from day 1
	going PRO gives you more storage for pictures, is that all?
	
how can i make it a *game*?

can i sell it to *time out*?

why would anyone *use*?

	because it's EASY to use. survival of the easiest


Navigation - the website must be EASY to use. navigation options must be at a minimal and they must tell
              you where you will go and what will happen there. 'Search and select' (http://m3mnoch.wordpress.com/2006/10/02/the-ps3-and-psp-interface/).
