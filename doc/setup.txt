New App Setup
=============

If you're reading this, then you've checked out a copy of this codebase from eco.local,
most likely using svn co svn://10.0.1.2/sites/site_template

Now, you need to switch this code from the site_template repository to a new repository,
namely the new app. To start with, remove all svn files and folders using the following
tip (http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/2486).

find . -name ".svn" -exec rm -rf {} \;

Check this has worked by running 'svn info', which should return an error. Next, you'll
want to add the codebase into a new svn repository.

svn import new_app svn://10.0.1.2/sites/new_app -m "Initial import"
rm -rf new_app
svn co svn://10.0.1.2/sites/new_app

Finally, you'll want to add the code to a new svn repository, using the following tip
(http://textsnippets.com/posts/show/596).

svn remove log/*
svn commit -m "Removed log files"
svn propset svn:ignore "*.log" log/
svn update log/
svn commit -m "Ignoring log files"
svn remove tmp/*
svn propset svn:ignore "*" tmp/
svn update tmp/
svn commit -m "Ignoring temp folder"

And that's it! Happy coding :D
